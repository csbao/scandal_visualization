    <h2>Writeup</h2>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    After binge-watching a couple of TV series over my staycation during spring break, I figured it might be an interesting task to try to visualize television scripts.
    I scoped this project into simply collecting some high-level metrics on speaker line length and twosome speaker interactions. However, with this data, you could also
    discover qualities about the nature of the speech as well to create more interesting visualizations.

    The input data lives in the data/ folder and they are structured in .txt files.
    <h3>Design decisions</h3>
    <p>
      For this assignment, I knew I wanted to show how two characters were
      related to each other, but had to do some thinking in how I would show
      that relation. Relative frequency was what I ended up with in the final iteration,
      where the shading of the cell is determined by two inputs:
      <ol>
        <li>the number of scenes the two characters have co-appeared</li>
        <li>the total number of scenes for the character who has appeared less, across the entire season</li>
      </ol>
      This was the best I could come up with to effectively show how two characters are "related", given the script data that I had on hand.


      <div class="grid-container">
        <div>
          <p>
          <b>Design point 1</b>: <br> Initially, I considered coloring the grid with the average of the counted lines from the two characters. However,
          this shows a trivial, non-interesting relationship between the two characters as the count for each character was computed separately (not together, as relative frequency will do).
          This skews the color towards characters who simply talk in the most scenes overall, as observed. In the final iteration, you can see that we colored the cells the
          proposed relative frequency metric.

        </p>
        <p>
         <b>Design point 2</b>: <br> Since there is symmetry in this matrix, half the grid is unnecessary.
        Tufte recommends minimizing data ink, so following his suggestions, I've cut the space in half and omitted the labels of one axis completely.
        The 45 degree rotation is done mainly for aesthetic pleasure, but I think there's a nice side effect in that the user
        can better see that the label applies to both axes.</p>

      The scenic lines minimap zoom interaction was a fun last-minute add when I realized that the graphic showing
      individual lines of speakers had the lines overlapping each other, just because there were so many lines and so
      little screen real-estate. I left them overlapping each other, and simply made it possible to zoom in on smaller
      spaces with the minimap. I made the minimap zoomable instead of the original scene lines, because I wanted to retain
      the ability to hover over the individual lines to see what the actual line text is.

      With the paired example on the right, I've hovered over the longest orange line to show Mellie's longest speech
      (measured by number of words). This is a good way to identify outliers and see if you can find the people
      who monologue the most :-P.

    <h3>Development process</h3>
    <p>
    Each component of the visualization was created separately, and then pieced together by the interaction support.
    The most tedious part was making sure things were aligned correctly given that the components were constructed in silos.
    The heatmap took the most amount of time, roughly 75% of this development, as I was trying to figure out how to
    actually create the matrix. I eventually just created a grid made up of squares laid neatly against each other.
</p>
    <p>The project took about 10 hours to complete, with some time taken to put in final tweaks to make sure things were
      neatly laid out, and that given a couple of different screen sizes, none of the components would be cut off.
    </p>
    <p>
    I did not guide the user through the interactive features of this visualization. However, I hope that it is intuitive to discover them.
    The brushing (crosshair pointer), hovering (highlighting of the half-matrix and hovering over the scene lines), and cross-filtering (clicking a matrix cell) are, to me, natural,
    and I hope they are to the user as well. Future work on the design could include a little more thought into the guidance of using the included features.
